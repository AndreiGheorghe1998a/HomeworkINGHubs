This is my try for the assignment from ING HUBS.

I've created a small application that allows you to:
- add a product
- retrieve informations about a product
- update the price for a product
- delete a product
- some methods that allows you to retrieve the informations for a list of products based on some criteria

The application is connected to my local postgreSQL database. 

Also, I've write the unit tests for the following HTTP Methods: put, post, get and delete.
